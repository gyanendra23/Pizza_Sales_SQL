# Pizza_Sales_SQL

🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Project
📌 Project Overview

The Pizza Sales SQL Project is a real-world data analysis case study designed to uncover valuable insights from a pizza store’s sales data. Using SQL, I explored sales patterns, customer preferences, and revenue growth to answer critical business questions such as:

Which pizzas are the best and worst sellers?

What are the most popular pizza sizes and categories?

When are the peak sales hours and days?

How is the cumulative revenue trend over time?

Which pizza types generate the highest revenue contribution?

This project demonstrates how data-driven decision making can improve operations, customer satisfaction, and profitability in the food & beverage industry.

🔍 Highlights & Insights

✔️ Top-Selling Pizzas – Ranked by both revenue & quantity sold
✔️ Customer Preferences – Most popular sizes and categories identified
✔️ Peak Ordering Times – Highest demand during evenings & weekends
✔️ Cumulative Revenue Analysis – Sales growth monitored over time
✔️ Revenue Distribution – Contribution by pizza type (Classic, Supreme, etc.)
